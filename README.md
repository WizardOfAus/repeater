# Repeater - Spaced Repetition
Simple yet useful effortless spaced repetition for any information you like! 

## TLDR; 
An app aims to send notification for reminding you an information you wanted to remember with increased time periods.
Why increased time periods because [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)


## What is it?
"Never memorize something that you can look up." famous quote by Einstein, for all my life I tried to live like this untill recently my navigation was not working and I was almost lost at somewhere I don't know in the middle of the night. Started to think it wasn't that hard to remember places and things pre-google maps era. 

Obviously we are smarter with our phones and computers with an access to information waterfall but also it creates huge dependecy in terms of memory. You can ask yourself what was the last time you tried to remember something instead of writing it down somewhere. It was very rare for me and made me think am I turning to Fish memory! 

Fortunately brain is very plastic and molds whatever you need to do! That's why I tried memory improvement application for sometime then saw the improvement. But many of them focus to short term memory which is kind of important but long term one is also. (Whole process is basically locating information in first ram then harddisk if we keep it stupid simple)

The connection what I've just told you with the project is simple Repeater is try to improve long term memory by memorizing some poem, learning new language, even learning programming !
